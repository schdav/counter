# Counter

Simple counter for mobile devices.  
The count is stored in a cookie which lasts one week.

It uses [Bulma](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma), [Ionicons](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionicons), [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) and [JavaScript Cookie](https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie).

:warning: Disclaimer: This is just a personal fun project, created because I needed a simple counter quick.
